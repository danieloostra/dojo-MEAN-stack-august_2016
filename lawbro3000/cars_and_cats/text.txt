Have localhost:7077/cars go to a simple HTML page that shows some cool pictures of different cars.  These car pictures should be stored in your images folder on your server.  DON'T just link to pictures of cars stored somewhere else!!
Have localhost:7077/cats show a simple HTML page with some cool pictures of cats.  Again, make sure these pictures are stored on your server.
Have localhost:7077/cars/new show a simple form where the user can add a new car information. For the /cars/new HTML page, no need to store this information in the database nor is there a need to validate the entries. Simply have the form there.
